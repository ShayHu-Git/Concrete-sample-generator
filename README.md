# Concrete-sample-generator
This plug-in is for generating the concrete geometrical model, delicating for the mesoscal modeling of concrete and multiple phases materials. 

Three modules are contained in the interface: 
(1) Mold generator. The shape and geometry of the 'mold' can be user-defined based on requirements in this module, the top and bottom cover can be deleted easily to let the particles fall in; 

(2) Rigid body setting. This module includes the parameters of mold and particles before simulation, as well as the calculation module of mass, including user-defined mass and density-based calculation based on volume of objects. By using this interface, the user can define the required parameters for packing simulation according to the different application scenarios; 

(3) Vibration setting. This module defines the direction, amplitude, frequency, offset of the induced sinusoidal vibration, as well as the simulation frame range setting. This open-source plug-in will provide a simple and straightforward tool for packing granular materials based on the physical engine.

Hopefully it is helpful for the researcheres of concrete domain.
